About this website
==========================

This website is created as a part of <b>Teknisk webbdesign och användbarhet</b> course work. It is required to install `node.js` and `npm` to do the task. `node.js` is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment and library. It is used for running web applications outside the client’s browser. `npm`  is a node javaScript platform’s package manager. “It is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management”. The command line tool, `composer` is installed for dependency management in PHP. In this website, Content Management System (CMS) `pico` is used. "`Pico` allows the user to manage the content of a page without having to "code" the page itself”. The command `composer require picocms/pico:^2.1.0` is used to install `pico`. It creates the file `composer.json` that defines the project requirements. A modern template engine for PHP, `twig` is also installed while installing `pico`. `normalize.css`, `sass`, and `stylelint` are installed by using `npm`. The CSS file `normalize. css` provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements. CSS pre-processor `SASS` is used for styling the website. `Stylelint` helps to fix the error in the stylesheet by reporting the bad code in CSS files.
