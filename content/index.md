About myself
==========================

I am Hafsa Choudhry, born and raised in Bangladesh. I live in Stockholm with my husband and my two daughters. I love to play badminton. Cat is my favorite animal. So I put here a cat picture.

Mathematics is my favorite subject since my childhood. So I did my bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics. During my bachelor's studies, I had some courses in computer science. My interest in computer science started at that time. I have started studying web programming at BTH with the dream of becoming a web programmer.
